**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python's Flask framework <br />
This website is built on HTML, CSS, and base JavaScript. All the boxes and the keyboard are built in JavaScript and styled with CSS. <br />
The flask server provides a list of words for the website to pick from, but the word bank is stored in the js file for use without an active server.
